# My userChrome.css

### WHAT?
This is my custom Firefox Qantum config file.</br>
No, this does not have anything to do with Chrome the browser. </br>
Rather, this is Firefoxes customisation file to make amendments to the appearance of the browser itself. </br>

### How?
 - Click on the hamburger button to open the main menu (top right hand corner)
 - Select Help
 - Select Troubleshooting Information 
 - Go to the Profile Folder
 - When Explorer opens, select the chrome subfolder to find userChrome.css
 - Edit as required

Remove the folder icon on the bookmarks bar so as to leave text only.</br>
Then use https://emojipedia.org to include custom icons/emoji in the name of a bookmark, instead of boring manila folder icons. </br>

Centre bookmarks across the bookmarks toolbar for a more easy to use UI.</br>

Added a change to the bookmarks bar font size.</br>
Increased that to 16px for better viewing.</br>
Whats interesting is that it also changes all the bookmarks menu font size, not just the bookmarks bar itself. Very nice!</br>
