# My Firefox Extensions
In case I need to re-create this in the future manually:

### Firefox Multi-Account Containers
THIS IS A MUST HAVE. </br>
Makes dealing with multiple accounts a breaze. </br>
Don't know why other browsers don't do this?!?!

### 1Password
Password management 

### uBlock Origin
Advertising and tracking blocking

### HTTPS Everywhere
Enforce HTTPS on all websites.</br>
When HTTP is only avialable, get a nice big notification where I have to manually allow HTTP.

### Grammerly for Firefox
This is a new one. </br>
Help with improving my writing.

### Dark reader
Make it a little easier at night on my old eyes.

### Tabliss
Load Unsplash images on every new tab to add a bit of wonder in my life.

### Twitter as a Sidebar
Add Twitter as a sidebar via the mobile version of the site, much like Vivaldi does that out of the box. </br>
Also need to add the sidebar button into the top ribbon manually.

### VivaldiFox
Adds a bit of customisation to Firefox. </br>
Much like Vivaldi, this allows the changing of the top navbar colour scheme instead of a Firefox theme.
